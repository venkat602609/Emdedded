#Unable to program Arduino using ArduinoIDE on MAC

note: this might help on windows as well.
I got frustrated with programming failures where it would get stuck with "programmer not responding" error

I would recommend trying this approach atleast to ensure that your device is in proper working condition.

1. First connect your arduino to the linux machine via USB
2. Download the arduino CLI using below command
wget -qO arduino-cli.tar.gz https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_64bit.tar.gz
3. Unzip the file
sudo tar xf arduino-cli.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin arduino-cli
4. Check if the installation was successful (You might have to include the /usr/local/bin to the path variable using $export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH")
arduino-cli version 
5. Now check if you are able to detect the board 
arduino-cli board list 
You should see something like:
Port         Protocol Type              Board Name  FQBN            Core       
/dev/ttyACM0 serial   Serial Port (USB) Arduino Uno arduino:avr:uno arduino:avr
6. Install the arduino core libraries
arduino-cli core install arduino:avr 
7. Now make a program to blink the internal LED. 
  * Create a directory names led_blink then create a file called led_blink.ino inside the folder with below content
  Note: you can change the time to some arbitrary value if arduino already has LED blink program is loaded(few vendors ship the device with this default program)

void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    delay(1000);
}
8. Compile the program using below command
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:uno led_blink
9. upload the code to arduino using below command ensure that the port is properly specificed. (you will get port from step 5 above)
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:avr:uno led_blink

Voila - you are able to program the board now via commandline.
